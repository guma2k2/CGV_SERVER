## Overview

The Booking movie website is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to booking movie ticket online. The project includes an Admin page for managing movies, cinemas, rooms, events and users and an Client page for search movies, view showtimes, booking movie tickets and view payment history. 

## System requirements

- Each screening event should have ticket price, start date and time, and the room where it will be held.
- The system should display the seating layout of a room and allow customers to select available seats.
